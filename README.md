Instructions:

Start the server and the database. They are both acting as servers, listening for connections. The server will connect to the database when it needs to collect the champion list.

Start client one and two. They will both try to connect to the server either as player 1 or player 2. The first client to connect is assigned as player 1, and the second client to connect is assigned as player 2.

From this point you can play the game from the clientâ€™s side. Selecting champions from the table roster that is sent to the client. Clients in turn select two champions, after which the match results will be calculated by the server and served to the clients.
